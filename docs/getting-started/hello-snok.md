# Hello, Snok! 🐍

To get started, you can build one of two types of projects with snok;

- [**📦 Packages**](./packages.md) - Create a bare-bones python project.
- [**🌎 Apps**](./apps.md) - Create a full-stack web application. (Frontends are coming soon 😄)

Snok natively integrates with [Modal](https://modal.com) for cloud deployments and for other infrastructure services like key-value stores for caching, job queueing, and GPU compute access.

Follow [this guide](./modal.md) to get started with snok and Modal.
